Though, generally speaking, there was such an opportunity and it was possible to play Rhe1, but that would have been another game. I tried to systematically fulfill the plan that I expected to end in a sacrifice.

%{\nf That was when I saw the possibility of a draw. Moreover, I felt that there was a possibility to continue the game, to play without the Rook, though I could not imagine what it would lead to. However, the image of the black King on a5 comforted my heart and intuition given to every man from birth, intuition of an "attacker" ( let's call it that way ) , told me that there would be decision and a mate net around the black King would be spun in spite of the huge material advantage of the adversary. Besides, I was whipped up by curiosity of unexplored. Will there ever be another opportunity to lure out the black King into the center of my own camp!? In the long run, Lasker's ancient game with a sacrifice on h7 and King's move g8-g1 was like a myth to us. Such a thing could happen only in those distant times, we assume. And suddenly, this opportunity! Topalov looked quite confident. He played }

%

%
%
%\end{enumerate}
%
%  22. ... Nbxd5  23. exd5  Qd6
%{\nf ( White to move ) It seemed to me that Topalov was a bit surprised, as he thought that attacking resources had dried out. A check on c6 was senseless, the Knight will be beaten, the King will go to b6, and there is hardly any opportunity for White to move his Rooks toward the black King. The d4-pawn safely protects the d-rank, and there are no squares for intrusion on the e-rank. Actually, this was not quite right, and my next move, made without any hesitation, turned out to be an unpleasant surprise for Topalov. }
%
%  24. Rxd4!!
%{\nf When I made this move, I saw only the repetition of the moves and the opportunity to continue the attack, though the whole picture of the combination was not yet clear. I already saw the idea 30. ..Rd6 31.Rb6, but I still could not get rid of the thought that all lines should be checked to the very end. Maybe black will find some opportunity for defense. Topalov spent about 15 minutes thinking. I walked around the hall - rather, I fled - and at these feverish moments it seemed to me that there were very few participants and that most of the games had already been finished. My mind worked only in one direction, and one of these moments brought me the image of the whole cluster of various lines. I saw the move 37.Rd7. I don't even remember how this line was formed in my head, but I saw the whole line up to the end. I saw the journey of the black King after 36.Bf1, 37.Rd7 and I could no longer suppress my excitement, because at that same moment I realized that the move 24. ..Kb6 ruined the whole construction. The mere thought that I could spoil such a combination drove me crazy, and I only prayed that Topalov would capture on d4. I still was not sure that this would win, but the beauty of the combination I saw impressed me. I could not believe my own eyes when Veselin twitched abruptly and grabbed the Rook. As he explained after the game, he was exhausted by the tense fight and he thought that White would have to force a draw by the repetition of moves after the Rook was captured. He saw the main idea of the combination, but it did not occur to him that White would play without the Rook, trying to make use of the King's forward position on a4. }
%
%  24. ...cxd4?!
%{\nf This move loses the game, but it is worth an exclamation mark, as great combinations cannot be created without partners. If Topalov had not taken the Rook, the game could have finished in a draw: Veselin would have had half a point more, I - half a point less. He would have win a little bit, I would have lost a little bit, but chess and chess amateurs would have lost a lot. However, Caissa was kind to me that day... I do not know what I was rewarded for, but the development of events became forced after the capture on d4. }

Two white Rooks sacrifice themselves, and thus, the way to the black camp is opened for White's pieces.
